Seeing your life as a movie plot and yourself as the protagonist sure makes the life a lot more interesting. My 22 year-long movie has had its own set of ups and downs, twists and turns, moments of character development.\\n\\nIt was the August of 2017 when the protagonist saw himself in the middle of a desert which was supposed to be his college campus. The only difference was the habitation. The place was bustling with members of the CS team, who were wearing a smile to hide their tensions and assure the students that living in the middle of the Thar Desert won\'t be as bad as we think. It was then when I first met my \\"Bhais\\" (4 years down the line who were going to get the award for the best people in supporting role :P).\\n\\nFastforward to 4 years later, when all my Bhais alongwith me were now placed in well off companies, when everyone in the group was now a grownup with responsibilities soon to be put on their shoulders. Despite all the hardships, pressures and difficulties we had faced, the bond among us had kept alive the child inside us, and I sincerely hope it stays that way. \\n\\nThese 4 years of college life changed the protagonist from an introvert troglodyte to a confident extroverted person, something that I thought would never happen.","line":"I didn\'t know my comfort zone could be a group of people until I met them....","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=16YVHHeWUNuxCk3H90iYk--6Q-XpnNaTN","filename":""},{"time":"5/28/2021 11:07:33","email":"kumar.70@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME029","name":"Mayank kumar Sharma","nickname":"","branch":"ME","about":"","line":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1waW-Xofb2WsxBki7rai5d9CEALRIWOYh","filename":""},{"time":"6/1/2021 22:30:55","email":"singh.28@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME030","name":"Mayank Singh","nickname":"Bhagona / Chacha","branch":"ME","about":"\\"It\'s not whether you get knocked down, it\'s whether you get up\\"-Vince Lombardi","line":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RurIncw4gvNVd8nwwzhkrI-GW7K7dk5e","filename":""},{"time":"5/17/2021 3:30:25","email":"tak.1@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME031","name":"Mayank Tak","nickname":"Mayank","branch":"ME","about":"The guy from Jodhpur, who was in Drama Club.","line":"In 4 years, after facing deadlines, professors, snakes and a epidemic, we finally made it.","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hRTLo2u74df8EBP1EIiOCmUF_BBeZqNS","filename":""},{"time":"5/28/2021 7:55:57","email":"kalyan.2@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME032","name":"MOGILI VAMSI KALYAN","nickname":"Fonsi/ Mowgli/stylish star","branch":"ME","about":"Underrated allrounder.","line":"Whenever u are get demotivated in chasing your dreams just think y did u started.","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NKnfdBArpRIFvaDK4cDF07YNMjBkQJnj","filename":""},{"time":"5/20/2021 9:50:01","email":"jindal.2@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME033","name":"Naman Jindal","nickname":"Naman ","branch":"ME","about":"","line":"Blissful experience, a lot of fun and a journey filled with wonderful experiences with wonderful people.","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=15L51EhKoHGhVztosNbk-vKCPqFkjsHXX","filename":""},{"time":"5/19/2021 23:40:49","email":"agrawal.8@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME034","name":"Pallav Agrawal","nickname":"bhai...","branch":"ME","about":"","line":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ib7tU1bc_2Kd9j8qRjK_80969J9JU7gA","filename":""},{"time":"5/19/2021 7:08:38","email":"kumar.66@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME035","name":"Pankaj Kumar","nickname":"","branch":"ME","about":"","line":"","photo":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oJpbX4hIbwwjnZnS5_rfWZW5wX2k8Ijx","filename":""},{"time":"5/17/2021 22:56:28","email":"rawat.2@iitj.ac.in","roll":"B17ME036","name":"Pareekshit Singh Rawat","nickname":"Pari ( short for Pareekshit) ","branch":"ME","about":"My life was very simple then I entered in IIT.
