                        repairing your favorite toy. Why do it? Because ROBTICS is ultimate blank canvas. It is human
                        right to be able to dig into anything you have in front of you from phone in your hand to
                        earphones in your ear to those remote controlled cars you had played with. You want to change
                        the way anything works. You want your car should go around building autonomously or may be
                        controlled by your voice. So that’s why we do it because it’s becoming more near to ourselves,
                        an expression, and an extension of our intelligent of our mentality to create and to destroy in
                        some ways. That’s why we do it. Point of club is to help you to get more into the tools

                    <p>Sports are known for producing the most remarkable athletes, colourful characters, influential
                        leaders and memorable heroes. IIT Jodhpur Student Sports & Games Society Committee reflects the same spirit of introducing
                        sporting activities to the campus community. This society aims to promote sports and exercise in
                        the true spirit of sportsmanship and motivate students to work with team spirit. We strive and
                        endeavour to inculcate and introduce this essential activity as a part of the daily decorum in
                        every student’s life. We at IITJ believe in bringing out and encouraging the sports person in

                        sports in a student’s life to instil the quality of vigour, pride, sacrifice and strive.</p>

                    <h5 class="h5-responsive blue-text darken-2">Athletics</h5>
                    <p>We athlete run, run until we defeat ourselves, run until our muscles tear and run until the track
                        cannot bear our footsteps. We run with pride and glory, until we can't run anymore but still we
                        run because we are athletes of IIT Jodhpur.</p>
                    <h5 class="h5-responsive blue-text darken-2">Badminton</h5>
                    <p>"I was written off by many as someone having mediocre talent. I faced a lot of challenges while
                        looking for someone to coach me. I was rejected by many who thought I was lacking in talent. I
                        am thankful to Almighty that he gave me parents who are my pillars of support and have struggled
                        a lot to give me the life I am leading today."<br><br>This was the answer of Saina Nehwal when
                        asked about her early life struggle while pursuing badminton. So the question is, what turned an
                        ordinary talent into world no 1. Again her answer was simple, "Hard work and practice". So why
                        can’t we, that's the belief in our badminton team. At last I just want to say "PRACTICE LIKE YOU
                        HAVE NEVER WON, PERFORM LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER LOST".
                    </p>

                    <p>Basketball is our life, rest all is distraction. We believe, ‘A basketball team is like the five
                        fingers on your hand. If you can get them all together, you have a fist” and that’s how we play.
                        Where each member is sure of himself and his contribution to praise the skills of mates, a team.
                        Being in basketball team of IITJ will not only build your character, it'll also reveal it.</p>

                        is not determined by one batsman or a bowler but by all the 11 players who make this team. After
                        all we know "Talent wins games but teamwork and intelligence wins championships."</p>

                    <h5 class="h5-responsive blue-text darken-2">Squash</h5>
                    <p>It never gets easier you just get better. To uncover your true potential you must first find your
                        own limits and then you have to have the courage to blow past them. So rise above your limits
                        and beat the best of you. It’s not whether you get knocked down; it’s whether you get up. SQUASH
                        is not just a game, it's the spirit of passion. Pain is temporary here but pride is forever.
